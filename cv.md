### Briefly About Myself:

After successfully graduating from BSEU with a degree in economics, I began my career as an economist (more precisely as an accountant) in a small outsourcing company. 
At the same time, I have always strived for development in creativity, that’s why I received a second high education in photojournalism at BSU. 
Being engaged in accounting and finance, I gained exceptional skills in accuracy to calculations, communication with different people and adhering to deadlines.

Developing further, I began to be interested in the field of international supplies and logistics and changed my career direction by getting a job with the company, which was the largest supplier of Shell oils in the Belarusian market. 
I worked there for 4 years in international supplies (logistics, declaration, hygiene) and received a huge experience in work with foreign suppliers, paperwork in English, developing my resistance to stress and the ability to learn and mobilize in various situations.
There I began to get interested in Frontend Development and after work I studied this direction on my own using resources on the YouTube. 
Further I went to the six-month [TeachMeSkills courses](https://teachmeskills.by/kursy-programmirovaniya/frontend-html-css-javascript-minsk), where I deepened my knowledge, but after passed them I considered my level of knowledge still not enough and continued to learn by myself.

After that, I changed my career in the direction of international finance and got a job as an international Financial Analyst at EPAM, where I am still working now. 
Having gained more than 2 years experience in the field of financial analysis, I realized that I would like to work in the field of Frontend Development. 
This sphere impresses me with the possibility of self-realization, the vision of the result of my work and wide possibility to develop my way of thinking.
Since October 2021, I have taken Intellect Fox courses to renew my knowledge in the field of Frontend development and from December 2021 I started taking RSS courses in EPAM in order to deepen my knowledge and become a worthy Frontend Developer in future.
I hope that my ability to learn, patience and self dedication will help me on this way, and I become a professional Frontend Developer.
